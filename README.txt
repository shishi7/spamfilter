Hello!
It's a simple spam filter. 
We've made it using naive Bayes Classifier principle. 
Problem with rare words was solved by simple ignoring of them.
Training set was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset 
There're several options to check the program. 
Just run a.exe. If there is no such a file or you want to compile the project - type a command in console:
g++ main.cpp training.cpp training.h executer.cpp executer.h
